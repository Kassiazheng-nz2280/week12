This is my envisioned final work, portraying how I anticipate its appearance. In total, there are 11 lights. I plan to utilize p5.js to craft RGB colors that seamlessly complement my mask. The sequence involves lighting the outermost one initially, followed by four lights in the second cycle, and five in the third. Subsequently, all lights will flash in unison five additional times before resetting and recommencing the cycle.
